# Import HTML

This plugin allows you to use Microdata to define Mavo attributes. E.g. `itemprop` instead of `property` and `itemscope`/`itemtype` instead of `mv-group`/`typeof`. This is useful if you were relying on this functionality, since it got removed in Mavo v0.2.0.

Note that you do **not** need to use this if youâ€™re using a value-less `property` and `itemprop` to provide the property name. That still works out of the box.
